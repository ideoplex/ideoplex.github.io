Hmmm. You would think that I would have learned my lesson when I picked [TextPattern](http://textpattern.com) over [WordPress](http://wordpress.com).

> __The Platform Wins__

I was idlely searching for GitHub on the IOS App Store and I found [OctoPage](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/octopage-blogging-jekyll-markdown/id649843345?mt=8), an app for jekyll on github pages. And I couldn't resist. So I spent $0.99 plus tax and took it for a spin. 

The verdict? Not quite ready for prime time. OctoPage needs some more polish when authoring posts. And it would be really nice if it were a universal app rather than iPhone only.

But the fact that it exists, along with Jekyll on GitHub pages and [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), is a strong statement that Jekyll really is the static weblog platform. And that I need to re-think my move to [Hexo](http://hexo.io/).
